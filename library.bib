abstract = {iSCSI: The Universal Storage Connection is an informative overview and in-depth guide to the emerging iSCSI standard, the technology that enables data storage, access, and management over networks, intranets, and the Internet. The iSCSI protocol reduces the total cost of ownership of shared storage solutions and enables an organization to tie together disparate systems and data, including both server class systems and laptop and desktop systems. Numerous leading technology companies, including IBM®, Cisco Systems®, and Intel®, are currently supporting iSCSI initiatives. Written for network and data storage professionals, this comprehensive book introduces iSCSI and explores its growing role within the data storage industry. It describes each element of the technology in detail—from session establishment through error handling—and examines the relationship between iSCSI and the SCSI protocol from which it evolved.},

@article{Mesnier2003,
abstract = {Storage technology has enjoyed considerable growth since the first disk drive was introduced nearly 50 years ago, in part facilitated by the slow and steady evolution of storage interfaces (SCSI and ATA/IDE). The stability of these interfaces has allowed continual advances in both storage devices and applications, without frequent changes to the standards. However, the interface ultimately determines the functionality supported by the devices, and current interfaces are holding system designers back. Storage technology has progressed to the point that a change in the device interface is needed. Object-based storage is an emerging standard designed to address this problem. In this article we describe object-based storage, stressing how it improves data sharing, security, and device intelligence. We also discuss some industry applications of object-based storage and academic research using objects as a foundation for building even more intelligent storage systems.},
